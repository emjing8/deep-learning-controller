Goal: 
A novel game controller powered by facial expression recognition using deep learning. Built using Keras and TensorFlow, this project demonstrates the power of learned classification in both interactive and abstract contexts â€” from controlling a tic-tac-toe game with your face, to general-purpose image classification.

Project Overview: 
This project explores how deep learning can be used to replace traditional input systems by learning patterns from data. Specifically, a neural network is trained to recognize **three distinct facial expressions** via webcam input and maps them to tic-tac-toe grid positions, allowing the user to **play the game using only their face**.

Stack:
- Python
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV (for webcam access)
- NumPy / Matplotlib (for preprocessing and visualization)
